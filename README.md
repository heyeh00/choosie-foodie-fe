Choosie Foodie (front end) is a chinese mini program built with love at Le Wagon, three members of Batch #1029. 

## Without further ado, here's the pitch:

We all want to hang out with friends. But no one wants to deal with organizing and triple checking everyoneâ€™s time and tastes.

Luckily, with Choosie Foodie we can live life the way it was in the good old days. Easy, no friction decision-making for a simple, minimalist, and happy life. 

Never again deal with non-commital maybes. Never again deal with "but but buts". Never go back and forth between friends trying to reach some semblance of a consensus. 

At Choosie Foodie, organizing a simple dinner with friends is finally simple. The way it should be.

## How it works

Filter by cuisines, set a date and time if you'd like, and create an event. Once created, share it with your friends on WeChat. 

Inside of the share link, everyone can vote on 20 restaurants and submit. Once the host submits their votes they'll have the option to end the voting. Once voting is complete, all attendees can view the event result. 

Easy, simple decision-making that really shows its value the more friends you have. 

## Ideas for future functionality

- Implement websocket for real-time result refreshing without the need for a refresh button.
- Show the attendees voting status; "not started", "voting", "done".
- Implement one swipable card per restaurant a la Tinder rather than twenty cards on one page. 

### Postface
